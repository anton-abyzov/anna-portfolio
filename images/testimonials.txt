## Student & Parent Testimonials

### The Petrov Family
**Gordey (10) & Alena (7)** - English & Russian Language
*"Anna makes learning languages fun! Gordey improved his English grades from B to A, 
and Alena now reads Russian fairy tales by herself. Anna's patience with younger 
kids is remarkable. She uses games, songs, and stories - they don't even realize 
they're studying!"*
- Lyudmila Petrova, Mother

### Nastya, 13 - Algebra I Success
*"I was failing Algebra until Anna explained it in ways that finally clicked. 
She broke down quadratic equations using real examples I understood. Went from 
62% to 88% in one semester! She's only a year older but teaches better than 
most adults."*

### Janeese, 13 - Piano Student  
*"Anna taught me piano for 6 months and I played at the school talent show! 
She's patient when I mess up and makes practice actually enjoyable. Already 
learned 5 full songs including one from my favorite movie."*

### Robert, 13 - Geometry Breakthrough
*"Geometry made NO sense until Anna showed me her visual tricks. She uses 
actual objects and drawings to explain theorems. Got 95% on my last test! 
She explains things multiple ways until you get it."*

### Andrew, 14 - Algebra II Honors
*"Anna helped me jump from regular to Honors Algebra II. She knows advanced 
stuff but explains it simply. We work through problems together, and she 
shows shortcuts teachers don't mention. Maintaining A- in Honors now!"*

### Aylan, 14 - Math Competition Prep

what judges want. Her problem-solving strategies are next level. Placed 3rd 
in regionals thanks to her coaching!"*
